# Project Gutenberg English Public Domain Book Tool

This Python script downloads and parses the official Project Gutenberg RDF metadata catalog to build a checklist of English-language public domain books. It supports marking books as completed, searching, and viewing the checklist status.

## Features

- Downloads and extracts the latest Project Gutenberg RDF metadata archive.
- Parses RDF files concurrently for speed.
- Filters books by English language and public domain status (configurable cutoff year).
- Optionally falls back to scraping the Project Gutenberg website for copyright info.
- Saves results to a CSV checklist with book ID, title, author, year, and completion status.
- Manage completed books with simple mark/unmark commands.
- Search books by keyword in title or author.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tqdm pandas requests beautifulsoup4


Usage
Run commands from your terminal:

python your_script.py build [--year YEAR] [--scrape]

    Downloads and parses RDF files.

    --year: Year cutoff for public domain (default: 1927).

    --scrape: Enable fallback web scraping for copyright status.

python your_script.py show
python your_script.py checklist

    Show checklist with completion status (✅ completed, ❌ not).

python your_script.py mark <book_id>

    Mark a book as completed by its ID.

python your_script.py unmark <book_id>

    Remove completion mark from a book.

python your_script.py search <keyword>

    Search for books by title or author matching <keyword>.


Output
english_public_domain_books_complete.csv: CSV file listing books with columns:

id: Gutenberg book ID

title: Book title

author: Author name

year: Publication year (if found)

completed: 0 or 1 (completion status)

checklist_books/: Folder containing .txt marker files named by book ID indicating completion.

Example
    Mark book ID 12345 as completed:

python your_script.py mark 12345

    Show checklist status:

python your_script.py show

    Search for books with "twain":

python your_script.py search twain

Notes
Ensure you run the build command before other commands to generate the checklist.

The RDF archive is ~600MB; extraction and parsing can take several minutes.

Adjust the cutoff year with --year to reflect evolving public domain laws.

Fallback scraping may be slower but improves accuracy for ambiguous copyright statuses.
